# Network Analysis Report  
### DNS | TCP Handshake | HTTP | ARP | TLS  

---

## 1. Introduction
This report summarizes the results of a Wireshark network capture session.  
It includes analysis of five essential protocols relevant to cybersecurity investigations:

- *DNS*
- *TCP (3-Way Handshake)*
- *HTTP*
- *ARP*
- *TLS/HTTPS*

These observations reflect normal network behavior and demonstrate foundational packet analysis skills.

## 2. DNS Traffic Analysis

### Summary
DNS converts human-readable domain names into IP addresses.  
The capture demonstrates a standard DNS query and response.

### Key Observations
- The client sent a *DNS A/AAAA query* to resolve a domain (example: example.com).  
- The DNS server responded with a valid IP address.  
- Traffic used *UDP port 53*.  
- No retransmissions or malformed packets observed.

### Security Notes
- No suspicious queries.  
- No signs of DNS tunneling or flooding.

## 3. TCP 3-Way Handshake Analysis

### Summary
TCP uses a 3-step handshake to establish reliable communication.

### Key Observations
- Captured the full sequence:  
  - *SYN* (client → server)  
  - *SYN/ACK* (server → client)  
  - *ACK* (client → server)  
- Sequence and acknowledgment values were valid.  
- No retransmissions, resets, or anomalies.

### Security Notes
- No evidence of SYN flood attempts.  
- No spoofed or malformed handshake packets.

---

## 4. HTTP Traffic Analysis

### Summary
An HTTP GET request was captured from an unencrypted site like neverssl.com.

### Key Observations
- Visible *HTTP GET request* with standard headers:  
  - Host  
  - User-Agent  
  - Accept  
- Server returned *HTTP/1.1 200 OK* with HTML content.  
- Traffic used *TCP port 80*.

### Security Notes
- No unusual redirects or payloads.  
- Shows why unencrypted HTTP exposes data to attackers.

---

## 5. ARP Broadcast Analysis

### Summary
ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses inside a local network.

### Key Observations
- Broadcast *ARP Request* asking for the MAC address of a specific IP.  
- *ARP Reply* confirmed the mapping.  
- Behavior aligned with normal LAN discovery.

### Security Notes
- No signs of ARP spoofing or MITM attempts.  
- No excessive or abnormal ARP activity.

---

## 6. TLS / HTTPS Traffic Analysis

### Summary
TLS encrypts communications on the web.  
The captured packets show a complete TLS handshake.

### Key Observations
- *Client Hello* contained cipher suites and TLS version.  
- *Server Hello* selected a cipher suite.  
- Server presented a valid certificate.  
- Traffic transitioned to encrypted application data.

### Security Notes
- TLS versions observed: *1.2 or 1.3* (secure).  
- Certificate matched the domain.  
- No downgrade attacks or weak cipher use detected.

---

## 7. Conclusion
The analyzed packets reflect normal and healthy network behavior.  
This analysis demonstrates understanding of:

- Protocol behavior  
- Packet structure  
- Network communication  
- Wireshark filtering  
- Security observations  

These skills support SOC Tier 1 investigations and cybersecurity fundamentals.
