# Wireshark Network Analysis

This repository contains hands-on network traffic analysis performed using *Wireshark*.  
It includes packet captures (PCAP files), screenshots, and written security analysis reports.

These projects helped me build skills in packet inspection, threat identification, and network investigation — essential skills for SOC Analyst roles.

## What I Analyzed

### *Normal Traffic*
- DNS queries and responses  
- HTTP GET/POST requests  
- TCP handshakes  
- ARP broadcasts  

### *Suspicious or Malicious Indicators*
- Unusual port scanning activity  
- Failed connection attempts  
- Suspicious IP addresses  
- Repeated SYN packets  
- Unencrypted credential exposure
